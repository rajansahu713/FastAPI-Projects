# This is a FastAPI application that provides a RESTful API for managing users in a MongoDB database. Here's a breakdown of the code:



## The code starts by importing necessary modules:

* FastAPI and HTTPException from the fastapi library, which is used to build the API.
* AsyncIOMotorClient from the motor.motor_asyncio library, which is used to interact with the MongoDB database.
BaseModel from the pydantic library, which is used to define data models.
* ObjectId from the bson library, which is used to work with MongoDB's ObjectId data type.
* List from the typing library, which is used to define a list of items.

## FastAPI App
* The code creates a FastAPI application instance, which is assigned to the app variable.

## MongoDB Connection

The code establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using the AsyncIOMotorClient class. The connection is made to a local MongoDB instance on port 27017, and the database name is fastapi_db. The collection variable is set to the users collection in the database.

## Data Models

The code defines two data models using Pydantic's BaseModel:

* User: This model represents a user with two attributes: name and email.
* UserInDB: This model extends the User model and adds an id attribute, which is a string representation of the MongoDB ObjectId.
Helper Function


## API Endpoints

The code defines four API endpoints:

1. POST /users/
    * This endpoint creates a new user.
It takes a User object as input and inserts it into the users collection.
It returns the created user with an id attribute.
2. GET /users/
    * This endpoint retrieves a list of all users.
It uses the collection.find() method to retrieve all documents from the users collection.
It uses the user_helper function to convert each document into a UserInDB object.
It returns a list of UserInDB objects.
3. GET /users/{user_id}
    * This endpoint retrieves a single user by ID.
It takes a user_id parameter, which is used to query the users collection.
It uses the collection.find_one() method to retrieve the user document.
If the user is not found, it raises an HTTPException with a 404 status code.
It returns the user document as a UserInDB object.
4. PUT /users/{user_id}
    * This endpoint updates a single user by ID.
It takes a user_id parameter and a User object as input.
It uses the collection.update_one() method to update the user document.
If the user is not found, it raises an HTTPException with a 404 status code.
It returns the updated user document as a UserInDB object.
5. DELETE /users/{user_id}
    * This endpoint deletes a single user by ID.
It takes a user_id parameter.
It uses the collection.delete_one() method to delete the user document.
If the user is not found, it raises an HTTPException with a 404 status code.
It returns a success message if the user is deleted.
Overall, this code provides a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing users in a MongoDB database using FastAPI.
