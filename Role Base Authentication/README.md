# Role Base Authentication with FastAPI
This repository contains a sample implementation of Role Based Authentication using FastAPI. Role-based authentication is a common strategy in software development where access and permissions are granted to users based on their roles within an organization or system.


## Introduction
Role-based authentication is a crucial aspect of application security, allowing administrators to control access to different parts of the application based on predefined roles assigned to users. This FastAPI project demonstrates how to implement role-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for securing endpoints.

## Features
* User registration and authentication
* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Token-based authentication using JWT
* Secure endpoints based on user roles

Creditional for Generating Token

```json
# 1
{
    "username": "user1",
    "password": "password"
}

# 2

{
    "username": "admin1",
    "password": "password"
}
```
